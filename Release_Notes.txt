Known Issues:
	Image becomes blurrier when selection move is finalized, 
		however the image becomes clearer when undoing
        Undo/Redo causes slight pixelization the first time they're used on newly drawn lines.
        Image move finalization doesn't keep opacity, makes transparent pixels into white ones.

Potential Features:
	Ability to change default Hotkey settings
